### Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois. I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Texas A&M University in 2014 and my Masters in Mechanical Science & Engineering from Illinois in 2017. My interests are in systems theory, dynamics & data analytics and controls. I am currently working on the application of tensorial/higher-dimensional techniques and machine learning to the analysis of biomedical time-series data. I also have a life long love of programming, technology and pet dogs.
